# Project 1 for enee350

1. Write a MIPS I assembly language program “Max.S” that prints the maximum between two
numbers inputted by the end user. Use system calls to input the two integers. Check to see 
if your program assembles. Run your program in MARS or QTSPIM and capture the 
screenshot of the display. Submit both the program and the screenshot.
2. Write a MIPS I assembly language program “NextToMax.S” that inputs 10 integers from the 
user, and finds the second largest numbe from them and prints it on the display. Use 
system calls to input the 10 integers and output the result. Check to see if your program 
assembles. Run your program in MARS or QTSPIM and cap
3. Translate (by hand) the given C program into an equivalent MIPS I assembly program. 
Check to see if your program assembles. Run your program in MARS or QTSPIM and 
capture the screenshot of the display. Submit both the program and the screenshot.

General instructions.
1. Add comments to the code.
2. Allocate all variables in appropriate memory section.
3. Pass input parameters through $a0 and return values through $v0
